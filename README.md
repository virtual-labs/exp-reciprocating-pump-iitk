### About the Experiment 

When mechanical energy is converted into stored mechanical energy or pressure energy by help of suction of the liquid into the cylinder with the help of the piston inside a cylinder which is reciprocating forward and backward, which in turn exerts the thrust on the liquid and henceforth increases its hydraulic energy or pressure energy. This kind of hydraulic machine is termed as reciprocating pump.
A reciprocating pump is also known as positive displacement pump. Since it discharges a fixed quantity of liquid. Reciprocating pump is mostly used in applications where a small volume of liquid is to be handled and delivery pressure requirement are quite high. :--|:--|
