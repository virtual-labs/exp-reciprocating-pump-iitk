### 8 Procedure<br> 
<b> 8.1 Formulae </b><br>
Under ideal conditions the discharge in case of double acting reciprocating pump is given by:<br>
1. Q<sub>th</sub>= ALN/60 – (A – a)LN/60<br>
= 2ALN/60 since (a << A) ......(1)<br>
Q<sub> th </sub> = theoretical discharge<br>
A = Cross-sectional area of the piston<br>
a = Cross – Sectional area of the piston rod<br>
N = Speed of the crank pin in RPM<br>
L = Length of stroke of the piston<br>
Co-efficient of discharge (C <sub> d </sub>):<br>
In a reciprocating pump, the actual discharge (Q<sub> act </sub>) is always slightly different from the theoretical discharge (Qth) due to the following reasons:<br>
(1) Leakage through the valves, glands and piston packing<br>
(2) Imperfect operation of the valves (suction and discharge)<br>
(3) Partial filing of the cylinder by the fluid<br>
2. C <sub> d </sub> = Actual discharge/Theoretical discharge = Q<sub> act </sub> / Q<sub> th </sub> ………….. (2)<br>
C <sub> d </sub> = Co-efficient of discharge of pump<br>
When C <sub> d </sub> is expressed in percentage it is known as Volumetric efficiency of pump. Volumetric efficiency depends upon dimensions of the pump and its values ranges from 85 – 98 %<br/>
3. Slip = Q <sub> th </sub> – Q <sub> act </sub> <br/>
% Slip = (Q <sub> th </sub> – Q <sub> act </sub>) *100/ Q <sub> th </sub> <br/> 
= (1 - Q <sub> act </sub>/Q <sub> th </sub>) *100 <br/>
= (1- C <sub> d </sub>)*100 .....(3) <br/>
The percentage of slip for well maintained pumps in good condition is of order of 2% or even less<br>
4. The power generated by Pump is given by<br/>
P = wQ<sub> act </sub> H <sub> m </sub> /75 …………..    (4)<br/>
Where, w = specific weight of liquid being pumped,<br>
Hm = Manometric head of the pump = …………..    (5)<br>
P<sub> d </sub> = pressure on delivery side<br>
P<sub> s </sub> = pressure on suction side<br>
V<sub> d </sub> = velocity of flow on the delivery side<br>
V<sub> s </sub> = velocity of flow on the suction side<br>
Z<sub> d </sub> = distance of pressure guage tapping on the delivery side of the pump axis<br>
Z<sub> s </sub> = distance of pressure guage tapping on the suction side of the pump axis<br>
H<sub> fd </sub> = head loss due to friction on delivery side = …………..    (6)<br>
H<sub> fs </sub> = head loss due to friction on suction side = …………..    (7)<br>
F = friction factor<br>
d<sub> d </sub> = Diameter of delivery pipe<br>
d<sub> s </sub> = Diameter of suction pipe<br>

<b>8.2	Procedure – </b><br>

1. Note down the diameter (D) and stroke length (L) of the piston, wattmeter constant k, distances Z<sub> d </sub> and Z<sub> s </sub> of the pressure gauges from the pump axis<br>
2. Start the motor and open the delivery valve fully<br>
3. Measure the discharge Q <sub> actual </sub><br>
4. Note down the pressure gauge reading P<sub> d </sub> and P<sub> s </sub> and also wattmeter reading X<br>
5. Measure the number of strokes occurring in a given time and hence obtain the speed of the piston in RPM<br>
6. Change the opening of the delivery valve<br>
7. Repeat steps 3 to 6 for atleast ten different openings of the delivery valve<br>
